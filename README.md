        Goal: Recreate a web page from a design mockup (image format) as closely as possible.
        Tools: HTML, CSS (including Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsiveness), and JavaScript when interactivity is needed.

    Skill Focus:
  
        Attention to detail: Ensure the design matches the mockup as closely as possible (pixel-perfect).
        Translating visuals into code: Convert static designs into dynamic, functional web pages.
        Pixel-perfect design: Match the layout, typography, colors, and spacing exactly.
        Responsiveness: Use media queries to make sure the design adapts to different screen sizes.
        Each day, you'll be given a static image of a web page design, and your task is to translate that design into a functional, responsive web page using the tools and techniques above.
